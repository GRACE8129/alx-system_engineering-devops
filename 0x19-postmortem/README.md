**Impact**: 20% of users experienced intermittent 500 errors  
**Root Cause**: Misconfiguration in Apache server's virtual host settings

## Timeline
- **14:00 UTC**: Issue detected by monitoring alert.
- **14:05 UTC**: Investigated Apache server logs and noticed 500 errors.
- **14:15 UTC**: Assumed initial root cause as high server load due to misconfigured virtual host.
- **14:30 UTC**: Restarted Apache service to mitigate issue.
- **15:00 UTC**: Issue reoccurred, continued investigation into virtual host configuration.
- **16:00 UTC**: Escalated incident to senior sysadmin team.
- **17:00 UTC**: Identified and corrected misconfigured virtual host.
- **17:30 UTC**: Issue resolved, monitoring confirmed.

## Root Cause and Resolution
### Root Cause
The 500 errors were caused by a misconfiguration in the Apache server's virtual host settings. Specifically, the virtual host configuration for the affected domain was incorrectly set, leading to server misrouting requests.

### Resolution
To resolve the issue, we corrected the virtual host configuration settings in the Apache server, ensuring that all domains were properly routed and managed by the correct server blocks.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
### Improvements
- Implement regular audits of Apache server configurations to catch misconfigurations early.
- Enhance monitoring systems to detect similar misconfigurations proactively.

### Tasks
1. Patch Apache server with latest updates.
2. Conduct a thorough review of all virtual host configurations.
3. Implement automated testing of virtual host configurations during deployment.
4. Enhance monitoring alerts to provide more detailed information about Apache errors.
